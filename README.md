# GDWeave.Sample

A sample for C# GDWeave mods.

## Setup

Clone/fork/whatever this repository and rename the following:

- Solution and project file name
- Project namespace
- `Id` field in `manifest.json`

To build the project, you need to set the `GDWeavePath` environment variable to your game install's GDWeave directory (e.g. `G:\games\steam\steamapps\common\WEBFISHING\GDWeave`).
